Component	Function	Developer Insight	
Tokenization	Breaks text into numerical IDs. Ensures all words are recognized (solves OOV problem).	Essential for managing context window size and API cost.	
Embeddings	Converts text into semantic vectors (numerical lists) for search.	Foundation of Semantic Search and RAG retrieval accuracy.	
Attention	The "A" in Transformer. Allows parallel processing and dynamic weighting of tokens for contextual accuracy.	Critical for ensuring the LLM correctly uses the retrieved context in RAG.
